# GShield

In build 24H2, Microsoft added a new boot device to Windows iso. The purpose of this is to have another, miniature OS
running alongside your desktop, invisibly. This script prevents it from booting, which will result with a BSOD and a 
non-bootable OS.
At this point, Windows OS should be regarded as spyware.
