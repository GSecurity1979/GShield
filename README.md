# GShield

In build 24H2, Microsoft added a software protection platform app to windows.

It's called Obsidian. 

This script blocks it's certificate, so you will end up with a non bootable OS.

It's tested and works fine on 22H2.

Obsidian serves to protect wswsc service and to download registry tweaks and policies to your device.

The only way to use this script on 24H2 is immediatelly after OS install, and never restart your device.
